(Strings)

ASCII - Not good for english

String in Python:
* String of characters
* "hello", "John Smith", "http://example.com"
* A string consisting of two lines:
 - "It goes on /n and on"

String Operations:
* Appending/concatenating two strings with +
	a = "tom"
	b = "my"
	print(a + b)
	> 'tommy'
* Length of String with len(s)
	len("tom")
	> 3
	len("")
	> 0

String slicing:
* Syntax: s[f:t]
 - s must be expression of type "str"
 - f and t are expressions of type "int"
* With step: s[f:t:p]
 - s is an expression of type 'str'
 - f, t and p are expressions of type 'int'
* Semantics:
 - Return the slice from position f to t but only choose every p'th character.
	"hello"[0:5:2]
	> "hlo"
	"hello"[1::2]
	> "el"
	"hello"[-1:0:-1]
	"olle"
* Syntax: s.m(p, ...)
 - s is an expression of type "str"
 - m is the nae of a string method (such as "count")
 - There are varying numbers of parameters p depending on the concrete method, separated by commas.
* Semantics:
 - Every string method has its own semantics!
	"hello".count("1")
	> 0
