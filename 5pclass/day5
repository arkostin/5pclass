(Programs vs Modules)
* Programs
 - Executed from start to en
 - (Usually a single purpose/function
 - Can use code from modules

* Modules
 - Only executed when invoked from a program
 - (Usually) includes basic functionsality for multiple purposes
 - Can use other modules

The "Main" Module
 - Goal: A Python file that is both a module and a program
 - Idea: Run main code if invoked as a program, use rest of code if not.

Importing Modules
 - Use the import statement
 - Members of that modules (functions, variables, classes, etc...) are referred to with:
	modulename.membername
 - Example:
	import math
	math.sqrt(4)

 - Can use different aliases:
	import math as m
	m.sqrt(4)
	
	from math import sqrt as sr
	print(sr(4))

	import math
	sr = math.sqrt
	print(sr(4))
