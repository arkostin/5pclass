Python- 
* We use Python 3 
* Includes Interactive Prompt and file parsing

Did a bunch of interactive coding w/ prompt and files
Demonstration of PyCharm/variables in Python

a = 3
b = 4
a + b = 7

BUT

a = '3'
b = '4'
a + b = 34

Second one happens because a and b are strings, and the '+' operator concatenates them.
Could achieve same result as first if 'a + b' was replaced with 'int(a) + int(b)'.

(Why we use these tools)
Most professors focus only on the mathematical/logical aspect of programming, but sometimes it's nice to be able to visualize every step of the process through a program like Pycharm.

(Expressions)
* Values
 - Numbers (Integers "int", Floats "float")
 - Strings
 - Boolean Values, Lists, Objects,..
* Variables
* Operations
 - Unary and Binary Operations
